### PR checklist

- [ ] Provide an overview of the changes you're making and explain why you're proposing them.
- [ ] Create a changelog snippet (add the `CHANGELOG-missing` label to this pull request in order to have a snippet generated from its title;
  or use `scriv create` locally and include the generated file in the pull request, see [scriv](https://scriv.readthedocs.io/)).
- [ ] Include `Fixes #NNN` somewhere in the description and `scriv` changelog entry if this PR addresses an existing issue.
- [ ] If this PR is not complete, select "Create Draft Pull Request" in the pull request button's menu.
  Consider using a task list (e.g., `- [ ] add tests ...`) to indicate remaining to-do items.
- [ ] If you would like to list yourself as a DataLad contributor and your name is not mentioned please modify .zenodo.json file.
- [ ] **Delete these instructions**. :-)

Thanks for contributing!
