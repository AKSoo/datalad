### Bug Fixes

- Improve handling of `--existing reconfigure` in
  `create-sibling-ria`: previously, the command would not make the
  underlying `git init` call for existing local repositories, leading
  to some configuration updates not being applied. Partially addresses
  https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/6967 via
