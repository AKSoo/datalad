### ðŸš€ Enhancements and New Features

- BF: The default layout of create-sibling-gitlab is now ``collection``. The previous default, ``hierarchy`` has been removed as it failed in --recursive mode in different edgecases. For single-level datasets, the outcome of ``collection`` and ``hierarchy`` is identical.
