    """Metaclass for repo classes, providing singletons.

    This integrates the singleton mechanic into the actual classes, which need
    to have a class attribute `unique_repos` (WeakValueDictionary).
    By providing an implementation of __call__, you don't need to call a
    factory's get_xy_repo() method to get a singleton. Instead this is called
    when you simply instantiate via XYRepo(). So, you basically don't even need
    to know there were singletons. Therefore it is also less likely to sabotage
    the concept by not being aware of how to get an appropriate object.

    Multiple instances, pointing to the same physical repository can cause a
    lot of trouble. This is why this class exists. You should be very aware of
    the implications, if you want to circumvent the singleton mechanic.

    Note:
        ATM the identifying key for the singletons is the given path in its
        canonical form. Symlinks are not resolved!
