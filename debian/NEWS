datalad (0.12.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  - More robust behavior across a wider range of use cases, and major
    changes in API and behavior, e.g. no support for Git-annex direct
    mode repositories anymore
  - Relative paths as arguments to commandline commands are now uniformly
    interpreted as relative to PWD
  - Extensive user documentation at http://handbook.datalad.org
  - `save` command fully replaces `add`
  - New `status` command with matching `diff command
  - Hook mechanism to execute arbitrary DataLad commands when configurable
    result patterns are observed
