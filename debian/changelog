datalad (0.0.4-1) neurodebian-devel; urgency=low

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Initial Debian packaging

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Add lintian override for insufficient dependencies of the 'datalad'
    package. All relevant dependencies are satisfied by the tightly coupled
    'python-datalad' package.
