Description: data files crawler and data distribution
 DataLad is a data distribution providing access to a wide range of
 data resources already available online (initially aiming for
 neuroscience domain). Using git-annex as its backend for data
 logistics it provides following facilities
 .
  - crawling of web sites to automatically prepare or update git-annex
    repositories with content from online websites, S3, etc
  - command line interface for manipulation of datasets
    (search, install, uninstall, upgrade, etc.)
 .
 This package provides the command line tool.  Install without
 Recommends if you need only core functionality.
 .
 DISCLAIMER:  DataLad is Work-In-Progress and this package is not yet
 for regular user consumption.  Primarily intended for demonstrations
 and development.
