Subject: comment out msgpack and duecredit in setup.py

  duecredit is absent on some elderly releases, and anyways
  not clear yet even why it was needed 

  msgpack -- for some reason on older systems even if installed
  system-wide from debian package, still attempts to pip install it
  for no good reason afaik
